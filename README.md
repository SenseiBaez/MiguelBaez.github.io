#### CODE REVIEW

A code review is meant to improve the quality of the code being reviewed. It can be used to share knowledge, maintain consistency, and mentor and teach. 

<code>You can watch the code review <a href="https://youtu.be/e_8JP0hHyc0">here</a>.</code>

#### Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

The first artifact of this portfolio is going to be making a GUI for the Jukebox Player, expanding on the functionality of the existing classes to 
expand the functionality of the GUI.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been instrumental in honing my skills and professional ethos, preparing me for a competitive role in the dynamic field of computer science. This ePortfolio is not just a showcase of my technical proficiency but a narrative of my journey, demonstrating how I've transformed theoretical knowledge into practical solutions. It highlights my growth the outcomes of this course.
Through the lens of teamwork and collaboration, my journey in the program was enriched by numerous group projects and team-based activities. One of those projects being the Jukebox Player that my artifacts are based around.
The ePortfolio showcases three key projects, each representing a core area of computer science. The first, the Jukebox Player GUI, demonstrates my skills in Software Design and Engineering. The enhancement demonstrates my proficiency in creating user-centric applications. The second enhancement, the Playlist GUI, reflects my understanding of Algorithms and Data Structures, showcasing my capability in object-oriented programming. Lastly, a database-centric Python application using SQLite highlights my expertise in Database Management and Functional Programming.
In essence, this ePortfolio is not just a collection of projects but a testament to my journey in the Computer Science program. It encapsulates my ability to adapt, innovate, and collaborate, positioning me as a valuable asset in the field of computer science. Each artifact in the portfolio is a piece of a larger puzzle, collectively demonstrating the depth of my technical expertise.

<code>Course Outcome 1</code>: I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by completing the code review before beginning any of the work on the enhancements. The code review allows developers to see potential areas of improvement. Another enhancement that also meets this objective is enhancement three. This enhancement was creating a database based off the data used for the Jukebox Player. The different artists, songs, and playlists. This enhancement demonstrated how to build a collaborative environment in which data can be seen by anyone, even people who might not have all the necessary experience to understand all the necessary principles.

<code>Course Outcome 2</code>: I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by completing enhancement one, Software Engineering and Design. This enhancement focused on creating a GUI that was user friendly and intuitive, professionally developed, and professionally written content. With tooltips and a user-friendly GUI, it really provides professional quality and good visual communication.

<code>Course Outcome 3</code>: I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices in enhancement two, Algorithms and Data Structures. For this enhancement, I implemented a HashMap in each student or user playlist and created a GUI to demonstrate the functionality. This enhancement used Object-Oriented Programming techniques, where each class had a HashMap implemented that helped better organize the songs that belonged in each playlist. I then created a GUI that demonstrated the HashMap functionality. It allows the user to better search for the songs and playlists and perform CRUD operations. Computer Science best practices and principles were used in the creation of the class to implement the GUI.

<code>Course Outcome 4</code>: I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals with enhancement one, Software Engineering and Design. I used well-founded techniques and principles to make the GUI class. Enhancing the functionality of the Jukebox Player provided value to the user.

<code>Course Outcome 5</code>: I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources with enhancement three, Databases. Since this project works with data, it was important to keep security at the forefront. One of the key steps that keeps the artifact secure is the fact that it is a local file and not hosted on the internet. I also tested SQL injections and they all failed, proving that the artifact is in fact secure.
