## <pre align="center">Playlist Database</pre>

For <code>Enhancement Three: Databases</code>, The artifact that was created here was a database filled with the data that has been used in my previous enhancements. That being the different musical artists and their songs, and the different users and their playlists.  This was created by me as the original scope of the artifact did not include having a database. A GUI was also created for the database to demonstrate the functionality of the database and the SQL queries that I created. This artifact showcases my ability to adapt and overcome. This undertaking involved all of the languages that I am very weak in, and I was able to overcome that obstacle and create the enhancement that I wanted.  By creating the relational database in SQLite, it demonstrated my ability to design a database schema by defining tables, specifying primary and foreign keys, and ensuring data integrity through constraints. 
I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in software engineer by meeting the course outcomes. I was able to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of Computer Science by using two programming languages to collaborate on a software project. In the professional world multiple developers can work on different aspects of a project. That would include the database design, the SQL queries, and the GUI development. So, by me using the two languages to achieve my end goal, demonstrates a collaborative environment. I demonstrated my ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by documenting the code with clear comments that indicate what is happening in different instances of both the Python code and the SQL code. Having a GUI is also a good example of a visual communication medium that is made to be coherent and user-friendly. I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms) by my SQL code. It demonstrated the usage of well-founded techniques and skills in database design, and the Python code showcases software engineering principles in GUI development and code organization. With the two languages combined, they implement a computer solution that delivers value by allowing the end-user to search for songs and artists.
This has been the most challenging enhancement for me so far because of my lack of knowledge in SQL and in Python. I had to spend a lot of time researching the different way to query things and how to link the SQL file and the database file to my Python file. Iâ€™ve never made a database on my own and that was a challenge that I had to overcome. This week was also a holiday week so that interfered with everything as well. I also learned a lot. I brushed up on my SQL knowledge and Python knowledge. I have a better understanding of the relationship between the SQL script and its database. I learned how to create a GUI in Python using tkinter. Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding experience. I know that I will be making many adjustments to the code for the final delivery.


I incorporated feedback I received previously from into this code. I made sure to comment the code to explain what is going on at each step and I included a header with the overall explanation of class functionality. This is the <code>PlaylistDataGUI.py</code>class.

#Date: November 26, 2023
#Version: 1.0

#Purpose:
#This script implements a playlist management system for the different user playlists.
#It includes functionalities to search by song title or artist.

#Revision History:
#- 1.0: Initial release. Script uses SQL queries to find songs by title or artist.

### <pre align="center">Original Project </pre>
The code for the first two enhancements was shared as the code used was the original jukebox player code. This third enhancement was made from scratch from the data from the Jukebox Player. The database was created from all the various artists, songs, and playlists from the various students or users if you will.

### <pre align="center">Final Design </pre>
This is the database, created with SQL, and the resulting GUI that I created using Python.
